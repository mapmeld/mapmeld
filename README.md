  ðŸ‘‹ Hey
</div>
 I am looking for a job on a web platform, especially if you are doing something cool with LLMs, maps, language, or helping people out.
 Most recently worked on an ML platform (HP Enterprise's Determined.AI) and a DIY redistricting site for educators and activists

 About me:
 - I used to be a digital nomad in Airbnbs: https://qz.com/643181/the-life-of-a-modern-day-nomad-who-hops-from-airbnb-to-airbnb-every-few-weeks
 - I successfully petitioned for Unicode to add ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¶, the Flag of Sark emoji (coming to most platforms in 2025)
