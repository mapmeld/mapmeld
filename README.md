 I am looking for a job on a web platform, especially if you do something with LLMs, maps, language, democracy, or helping people out.
 Most recently worked on an ML metrics platform, and a DIY redistricting site for educators and activists.

Fun facts:
 - I used to be a digital nomad in Airbnbs: https://qz.com/643181/
 - I successfully petitioned for Unicode to add ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¶, the Flag of Sark emoji (coming to most platforms in 2025)
 - A photo that I took will be in the Smithsonian (exhibit opening in 2026?)
 - Some of my LLMs have been used in research, and I [added some bug-fixes](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amapmeld+is%3Aclosed) to Transformers
