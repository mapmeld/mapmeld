 I am looking for a job on a web platform, especially if you do something with LLMs, maps, language, or open government.
 Most recently worked on an ML metrics platform, and a DIY redistricting site for educators and activists.

ML open source:<br/>
Contributed tasks to the BIG-Bench benchmark, and bug fixes to EleutherAI's eval harness + HuggingFace's lighteval.

Fun facts:
 - I used to be a digital nomad in Airbnbs https://qz.com/643181/ - lived in dozens of neighborhoods in NYC and the Bay Area
 - I successfully petitioned for Unicode to add ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¶, the Flag of Sark emoji (coming to most platforms in 2025)
